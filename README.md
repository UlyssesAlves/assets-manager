## What Would I Improve If I Had More Time?

I've implemented all the requirements for this challenge project. But as with any project time is finite, which means we can always focus on implementing the most important features and solve the most problematic errors first, leaving secondary features and minor changes and bugs to be implemented or fixed on the next versions of the software.

On this particular project, if I had more time I would work on the following pending items:

- Implement unit tests for the app.
- Improve the filter so that the user could tap the “Apply Filter” button whether the text filter field is filled or not.
- Title image background is slightly different from the black background. Could be improved too. Very simple detail.
- (Bug Fix) Top items ont the tree (those which are direct children of the root node) can’t be collapsed when filter is applied.
- The deepest nodes on the assets tree are getting their names trimmed on the right side of the screen. An option to solve this would be allowing the user to scroll horizontally to view the names of these items and also possibly their status icons.
- It would be good to be able to clear the text filter by hitting a button or icon. For now I've implemented a button which clears all the filters, but having the hability to clear just the text filter would be nice.
- Define an icon for the app.
